The​‍​‌‍​‍‌ world is full of different smart parking systems that include automatic pay stations and barriers, auto pay parking systems, active RFID parking systems, robotic parking systems, Parking Guidance and Information System (PGIS), transit-based information system, smart payment system, e-parking, and automated parking<sup>[1]</sup>. This Human Computer Interaction (HCI) project focused on identifying the typical issues with indoor car parking systems as well as an innovative solution of a smart parking system to solve the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌problem.


Based on the research, the conventional indoor car parking system does not provide the drivers regarding the availability of parking spaces. As a result, many of the drivers who enter the parking lot waste their time searching for parking. The conventional indoor car parking system will just open the barrier when drivers press the automated machine for tickets or tap their TouchNGo card to enter without showing the availability number of parking spaces<sup>[1]</sup> which can be shown in Figure 1.1 below.

This will not only cause unnecessary user usability problems which are a waste of time and fuel but it will also pollute the environment. ​Studies revealed that the time used by drivers looking for available parking spots (termed as "cruising") which can be shown in Figure 1.2 is a major cause of the increase in vehicle miles traveled as well as the release of greenhouse gases.

Just to present one case, the average cruising time in the city of Los Angeles of more than 3 minutes per driver has brought about an additional 932,000 km of vehicle miles driven and 730 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year<sup>[2]</sup> and can contribute to a negative user driving experience where the drivers will feel frustrated and stress<sup>[3]</sup>.

Most modern buildings such as shopping centers, airports, universities, and business buildings have large indoor car parks that cover several floors and hundreds of parking spaces. While these parking lots are designed to accommodate more vehicles, they often leave drivers with a difficulty remembering where they left their cars. After a day of work or shopping, many people find themselves wandering through parking levels trying to recall where they left their vehicles<sup>[4]</sup>. This not only causes frustration and stress but also waste valuable time and be the cause of unnecessary traffic congestion inside the parking areas.

One of the primary usability issues in today's parking facilities is the inefficacy of finding a parked car. Most current facilities use basic numbering schemes marked on pillars or painted walls. These labels are easy to miss or forgotten, particularly if the driver is rushing. For example, a driver might just remember parking "by the elevator" or "next to a red car," but both of those memories are encountered useless because all those parking slot designs are the same at the whole building which can be shown in Figure 2.1 below. Some people even manually mark down their parking spot by taking down the labelled number on the painted wall or just taking a photo of it as shown in Figure 2.2 below. These extra steps are not convenient for users who want quick, one-touch solutions.

Based on the study by Mora, Allard, and Zurob (2014), wayfinding behavior in large parking lots, particularly those in shopping malls, often leads to significant user difficulties. The researchers found that many drivers forget not just which level they parked on, but even the exact spot, making their return trip stressful and inefficient<sup>[4]</sup>. This will make drivers spend unnecessary minutes searching their cars, typically often circling the area multiple times. This causes many users to feel anxiety, annoyance or panic when they cannot find their cars, particularly in crowded parking structures. This kind of negative emotional result decreases their level of comfort with the overall parking service and creates an unpleasant impression of the building. For instance, after spending the entire day shopping, users might forget which floor they parked on, thus turning an enjoyable day into a stressful experience.

Overall, the difficulty of locating parked vehicles in large multi-level parking facilities highlights a major usability issue that affects both efficiency and user satisfaction. As demonstrated by Mora, Allard, and Zurob (2014), poor wayfinding design contributes to confusion, emotional stress, and wasted time for drivers<sup>[4]</sup>. These challenges show the need to improve parking management systems and smarter navigational aids that can help users easily locate their vehicles. Implementing such solutions would not only enhance user convenience but also reduce congestion and improve the overall perception of modern parking facilities. 

Other than the problems of finding available parking spaces and locating one’s own car, ladies’ parking, which serves as designated bays for female drivers, is often misused. These spaces are reserved specifically for single women, groups of women, and single mothers with boys under 12 years old<sup>[5]</sup>. According to a survey by LiveView Technologies (LVT), 69% of women reported feeling unsafe in parking lots, which often influences their decision to visit shopping malls<sup>[6]</sup>. A real and tragic example is the Canny Ong case, where she was abducted from a parking lot in 2003. This incident serves as a strong reminder of the importance of ensuring women’s safety in conventional indoor parking systems.

Ladies’ parking areas are designed with security guards and numerous CCTV cameras that provide constant monitoring to help prevent suspicious individuals from committing crimes which can be shown in figure 3.1. They are usually located close to the main entrances and exits, with wider parking spaces and fewer blind spots for better visibility. In addition, the lighting in these areas is much brighter compared to regular parking spaces, making them easier to notice and safer to navigate. Overall, ladies’ parking helps reduce crime rates, ensure women’s safety, and allow female drivers to feel secure even during late hours or in less-crowded areas.
