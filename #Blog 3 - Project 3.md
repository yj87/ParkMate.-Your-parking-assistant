## 3.0 Wireframes
### 3.1 Task 1
https://www.figma.com/design/WG0JMuAYs9obhvpHOtCm9O/HCI-P3--Copy-?node-id=0-1&t=kWx0wgDEyrx05WtN-1
<p align="center">
<img width="869" height="667" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29fc83aa-a705-4ca4-801e-1dd98ed75309" />

  <em>Figure 3.1 : Wireframe 1</em>
</p>

The wireframe design for Task 1: Find Parking incorporated both Shneider’s Golden Rules and design requirements from Project #2. 
Shneider’s Golden Rules:
The wireframe design for Task 1: Find Parking incorporated both Shneider's Golden Rules and design requirements from Project #2.

**Shneider's Golden Rules:**

1. **Strive for Consistency**
<p align="center">
<img width="650" height="463" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b00234d-4559-4918-b1f4-0fd1d872b32c" />
<br>
</p>

Consistency is strongly maintained throughout the application interface. Every page uses the same bottom navigation bar, which includes Menu, Wallet, Settings, Profile, and Notifications icons. The position, icons, and interaction behaviour do not change across pages.

Moreover, the colours of the parking slots remain unchanged:
- Red always shows occupied parking slots
- Green always shows parking slots that are free
- Pink always stands for ladies' parking
- The wheelchair icon is always used for OKU parking

Such consistency helps the users to understand the system rapidly and apply their knowledge from one page to another without any mistake, thus the usability is raised and the number of errors is diminished.

2. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts**
<p align="center">
<img width="450" height="366" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761c3429-0106-4773-b035-15ad461ef16c" />
<br>
</p>

The system has been designed to provide frequent users with a smooth and quick manner of interaction by removing the unnecessary steps. The users are permitted to:
- Directly choose a level and zone
- Press the Search button
- Immediately pick a parking space from the colour-coded layout

There is no need for long instructions or complicated menus. The always visible bottom navigation bar also serves as a shortcut, enabling users to switch rapidly to other main sections of the app whenever they want. In this way, the app becomes time-saving and efficient for repeat users who already know the workflow.

3. **Offer Informative Feedback**
<p align="center">
<img width="170" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53925177-8c7c-4d41-a10c-fc17bf5b1749" />
<br>
</p>

The system delivers explicit and prompt feedback to every user action. If a user picks a parking slot:
- A success message is displayed if the slot is free

This has helped a lot in removing the awkwardness of not knowing and providing clear information to the user about what they have done through each action.

4. **Design Dialogs to Yield Closure**
<p align="center">
<img width="170" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6418e2d7-536c-4f7b-94fa-717e2b89cf06" />
<br>
</p>

The system sequences for every task have not only a clear start and a middle but also an end. When the user completes the navigation for parking:
- A notification confirms the arrival
- A dialog lets the user know if he/she wants to exit the “Find Parking” task

It gives users a firm feeling of closure and a kind of reassurance that the work has been successfully fulfilled. Otherwise, without such closure, users might be wondering if the system is still operational or if there is a need for further action.

5. **Offer Error Prevention and Simple Error Handling**
<p align="center">
<img width="170" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd73e4ca-ce5c-4a8b-b200-b800e1055f41" />
<br>
</p>

Great effort has been put into the design with a view to preventing errors and only handling them softly when they do appear. Red coloured parking spaces that are already taken serve as a clear indication to users that they should not select those parking spaces.

What the system does not do is to penalize a user who picks an occupied slot. Instead, it gives a friendly message to the user asking him/her to choose another slot. This way of dealing with the situation lowers the level of user frustration and keeps the user experience positive and ​‍​‌‍​‍‌pleasant.

6. **Permit Easy Reversal of Actions**
<p align="center">
<img width="168" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce13ecbf-9050-4bc2-a867-d7e2a59faea5" />
<br>
</p>

At any point in the series of operations, users have the ability to undo or reverse their actions. Every page has a return (back) button which enables users to:
- Change the selected level or zone
- Cancel the parking selection

The users are thus not trapped in a sequence and they can recover from mistakes without having to start the entire process over again. By giving this option, the app lessens the user's anxiety and irritation, thus the user feels more comfortable to choose different options and the app becomes more user-friendly in character. Users can go through the system with confidence, knowing that if they make mistakes, these can be easily ​‍​‌‍​‍‌rectified.

7. **Support Internal Locus of Control**
<p align="center">
<img width="170" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6418e2d7-536c-4f7b-94fa-717e2b89cf06" />
<br>
</p>

Users keep control over choices such as whether the camera can be used for AR navigation, and when to leave the find parking function, which is a great combination of both user confidence and user experience. The system does not dominate but rather acts as a facilitator, delivering suggestions and some visual help but not pushing the user to take any actions.

For instance, users have the right to choose whether they want to allow camera access for AR navigation or not, and they also decide when to finish the “Find Parking” operation and get back to the main menu. The system never, at any point, seizes control or goes ahead without the user’s permission.

The design through which users are permitted to decide on their own diminishes frustration, trust in the system gets stronger, and users become more responsible for and confident in their interactions with the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌app.

8. **Reduce Short-Term Memory Load**
<p align="center">
<img width="172" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dfcbe14-5c9f-4d79-88c8-b1a7394d588e" />
<br>
</p>

The use of colour coding, intuitive icons, and AR guidance eliminates the need for users to remember complex instructions or sequences of steps. By visually representing information directly within the interface or environment, users can quickly recognize and act on cues without relying on memory. 

This approach reduces cognitive effort, minimizes errors, and allows users to focus more on completing their tasks efficiently. For example, in a parking navigation app, highlighting available slots with distinct colours and overlaying AR arrows to guide the driver directly to the spot ensures that users don’t have to remember directions or parking rules, making the experience smoother and less mentally taxing.


**Design Requirements from Project #2:**

Firstly, the wireframe keeps the process of recognizing indicator light in the building when finding parking slot and adds new features which are colour-coded parking boxes in the application, which directly reflect real-world parking indicators where red light indicates occupied slots, green light indicates available slots and pink light for ladies parking which in turn provide an interactive mobile application. This maintains intuitive understanding and allows users to assess availability instantly. 

In addition, the wireframe design also adds the new feature which is IoT-Based Real-Time Parking Availability. Parking slot statuses are updated in real time using IoT sensors, ensuring that the displayed availability accurately reflects the actual parking condition. Moreover, the wireframe also keeps the process which is lane and floor scanning and adds a new feature where the level and zone selection feature enables users to select different floors and zones efficiently, matching natural user behaviour when searching for parking. On the other hand, the wireframe design also supports differentiation for reserved slots. As from the wireframe, it can be shown that ladies’ parking and OKU slots are clearly differentiated using distinct colours and icons, preventing confusion and misuse.

Apart from that, innovative new features which are GPS & Indoor Positioning and Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation are incorporated in the wireframe design for the finding parking task. The design assumes GPS for initial positioning and Bluetooth beacons for indoor accuracy, ensuring reliable navigation inside parking structures. Furthermore, AR navigation overlays directional arrows onto the camera feed, guiding users step-by-step to their selected parking slot and reducing search time.

### 3.2 Task 2

Flow 1: User Parks, Pay and Locates Car

<p align="center">
<img width="869" height="667" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a31d8f3d-b10c-4fdd-b67d-c1759e445ba3" />

<br>
  <em>Figure 3.2 : Wireframe 2</em>
</p>

The wireframe design for Task 2: Find My Car incorporated both Shneiderman’s Golden Rules and design requirements from Project #2.

**Shneiderman’s Golden Rules**

1. **Strive for Consistency**
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="292" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87429986-0f47-4ec6-ad05-dad8e8dda68c" />
<br>
</p>

Consistency is carefully maintained throughout the “Find My Car”  feature. The same bottom navigation bar (Menu, Wallet, Settings, Profile, Notifications) is used across all screens, and the layout structure remains unchanged during the car-finding process.

Icons such as the car symbol, location pin, and navigation arrows are consistently used from the moment the car location is displayed until the user arrives at the vehicle. Text style, button placement, and confirmation dialogs (YES/NO) also remain uniform.

Such consistency allows users to transfer knowledge easily from one screen to another, reducing confusion and improving usability, especially for elderly users who prefer predictable interfaces.

2. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts**
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bfbc13b-3ffb-4b85-b6dd-f7e01d4a6346" />
<br>
</p>

The system supports frequent users by minimizing unnecessary steps when locating their parked car. Users are allowed to:
- Access the “Find My Car” function with a single tap
- Automatically retrieve the saved parking location without manual input
- Start navigation immediately without configuration

There is no need for users to remember or re-enter parking details such as floor or zone. This design makes the task fast and efficient when finding their car.

3. **Offer Informative Feedback**
<p align="center">
<img width="366" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8231c19a-0fb0-436a-9a94-c4a9a9c15cc7" />
<br>
</p>

The system provides clear and immediate feedback throughout the entire “Find My Car” process. For example:
- The app displays the exact parking location (Level, Zone, Slot)
- The user’s current position is shown during navigation
- Distance and direction updates are continuously provided
  
This continuous feedback reassures users that the system is working correctly and that they are progressing toward their goal, reducing uncertainty and frustration.

4. **Design Dialogs to Yield Closure**
<p align="center">
<img width="176" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7d2d973-4541-4f0d-b690-f4b0f10dcb39" />
<br>
</p>

Each interaction sequence in the “Find My Car” task has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Once the user reaches their parked car:
- A “You Have Arrived” notification is displayed
- An EXIT option is provided to conclude the task

This clear closure helps users understand that the task has been successfully completed and prevents confusion about whether further action is required.

5. **Offer Error Prevention and Simple Error Handling**
<p align="center">
<img width="370" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/407efaa3-023c-49c5-869b-e1d667faa32c" />
<br>
</p>

The system is designed to prevent errors by relying on automatic location logging rather than manual user input. When the process of making payment fails, the system will also display errors and ask the user to try again. This avoids common mistakes such as wasting time for confirmation or entering incorrect details.

Error handling is gentle and informative, ensuring that users remain calm and confident while using the app.

6. **Permit Easy Reversal of Actions**
<p align="center">
<img width="176" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7d2d973-4541-4f0d-b690-f4b0f10dcb39" />
<br>
</p>

Users can easily reverse or cancel actions at any stage of the “Find My Car” process. At any time, users can:
- Stop navigation
- Go back to the previous screen
- Exit the “Find My Car” feature

This flexibility ensures that users are never trapped in a sequence of actions and can recover easily from mistakes without restarting the entire task. As a result, user anxiety is reduced and confidence in using the system is increased.

7. **Support Internal Locus of Control**
<p align="center">
<img width="357" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33c85ee6-b361-48bb-9d36-220ed5461905" />
<br>
</p>

The “Find My Car” feature gives users full control over their interactions. Users decide:
- When to start navigation
- Whether to use AR navigation
- When to exit the task

The system acts as a guide rather than forcing actions on the user. By allowing users to control the pace and flow of interaction, the design increases trust and ensures a more satisfying user experience.

8. **Reduce Short-Term Memory Load**
<p align="center">
<img width="357" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45239c0c-9c54-4274-b4be-9f9f31dbe958" />
<br>
</p>

The system eliminates the need for users to remember parking details by continuously displaying relevant information on the screen. Floor, zone, slot number, and navigation cues are visually presented at all times.
By using clear text, icons, and AR directional arrows, users can simply follow visual cues rather than recalling information from memory. This significantly reduces cognitive load, especially for elderly users and those under stress.

**Design Requirements from Project #2:**

The wireframe design for the “Find My Car” task incorporates and extends the design requirements established in Project #2 by maintaining the core idea of assisting users in locating their parked vehicles while enhancing accuracy and usability through additional features. The system keeps the basic concept of saving parking location but enhances it by introducing automatic location logging, ensuring accurate recording of the car’s floor, zone, and slot without relying on user memory. This reduces dependency on memory and prevents errors caused by forgetting parking details.

In addition, the wireframe integrates indoor positioning technology using Bluetooth beacons to overcome the limitations of GPS in multi-level indoor car parks. This ensures precise navigation even in underground areas where GPS signals are weak or unavailable.

Furthermore, the design introduces Augmented Reality (AR) navigation, which overlays directional arrows and distance indicators onto the camera view. This guides users step-by-step back to their vehicle, reducing unnecessary walking and confusion in repetitive parking layouts.

Overall, the wireframe directly addresses the user problems identified in Project #2, such as memory overload, disorientation, and inefficient searching. By combining automatic data logging, accurate indoor positioning, and AR-based navigation, the system minimizes memory reliance, reducing cognitive load, and provides clear, reliable indoor navigation for locating parked cars efficiently and safely.

<br>
  <em>Figure 3.3 : Wireframe 3</em>
</p>

The wireframe design for Task 3: Ladies Parking incorporated both Shneiderman’s Golden Rules and design requirements from Project #2.

**Shneiderman’s Golden Rules**

1. **Strive for Consistency**

Consistency is maintained throughout the ParkMate application, including within the “Ladies Parking” feature. The navigation bar, which consists of Menu, Notifications, Profile, Wallet, and Settings, is consistently displayed on every screen regardless of user interaction. 

In addition, visual elements such as car symbols, the “Location” search bar, and navigation arrows follow a uniform design across all features. Font type, font size, and button styles are also standardized to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user interface.

<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="385" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36236b4e-a128-4a45-aa8c-3b584ecdbf96" />
<br>
</p>

When selecting a parking slot, the system displays an overview of the parking layout using consistent colour-coded symbols across different features:
- Pink for ladies parking
- Red for occupied parking
- Green for OKU parking

<p align="center">
<img width="365" height="385" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/decc66fc-59b0-4845-89cf-ab333c2436fa" />
<br>
</p>

Furthermore, the navigation process guiding female drivers to Ladies Parking follows a standardized interaction flow. Female drivers are required to grant camera access and select their desired parking slot upon arrival at the Ladies Parking area. This uniform process enhances usability, reduces cognitive load, and ensures a smooth and predictable user experience.

2. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts**
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="381" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bfbc13b-3ffb-4b85-b6dd-f7e01d4a6346" />
<br>
</p>

The system supports frequent users by minimizing unnecessary steps when locating their parked car. Users are allowed to:
- Access the “Find My Car” function with a single tap
- Automatically retrieve the saved parking location without manual input
- Start navigation immediately without configuration

There is no need for users to remember or re-enter parking details such as floor or zone. This design makes the task fast and efficient when finding their car.

3. **Offer Informative Feedback**
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="385" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b472783f-5613-4f80-a13c-c5e8f0ea4c98" />
<br>
</p>

The ParkMate application is designed to support frequent users by providing clear and direct shortcuts that minimize interaction time. 
- The main menu displays Find Parking, Find My Car, Ladies Parking for quick access. 
- Location search bar available on all pages for fast destination search.
- Persistent navigation bar gives access to the main menu, notifications, profile, wallet, and settings.
- Automatic detects their current location and starts navigation.
- Female drivers can tap directly on parking slots that the system provides for navigation guidance.

Efficiency and usability are improved with fewer steps and faster decision-making. This familiar shortcut improves usability by giving users full control over navigation and reducing confusion during task execution.

4. **Design Dialogs to Yield Closure**
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="391" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa7e25a9-879e-4888-8c0b-2096b6429d88" />
<br>
</p>

ParkMate provides clear and immediate feedback to female drivers at every important stage of the ladies’ parking process to ensure they understand the system status and next action.
- When the driver reaches the ladies’ parking area, the system displays “You’ve arrived” highlighted in green with a green arrow icon to confirm successful navigation.
- Before entry, the app reminds the user to scan her face at the barrier, ensuring the required action is clear.
- After successful facial verification, a green tick icon appears with the message “Access granted, barrier opening” to confirm approval.
- If the user selects an available parking slot, the system shows a successful confirmation on the selected slot and starts navigating them.
- Once the driver reaches the selected empty slot, the system again confirms arrival.

ParkMate incorporates effective error prevention and simple recovery mechanisms to ensure a smooth and secure user experience. During access to the ladies’ parking area, facial recognition is used at the barrier to verify the user’s identity. If the scanned face does not match the registered profile in the database: 
- The system immediately displays an “Access Denied” message accompanied by a red cross icon. 
- The user is then given the option to retry the scan or contact assistance. 
- To prevent misuse, the system limits verification attempts to three tries, after which the user is redirected to general parking.

In addition, ParkMate also minimizes user errors by preventing female drivers from selecting invalid parking options. Occupied parking slots are clearly marked in red and are disabled from selection, reducing the chance of accidental errors. 

If a user attempts to tap an occupied slot, the system immediately displays a clear message indicating that the slot is unavailable and prompts the user to select another vacant space. This simple and direct handling prevents confusion, reduces frustration, and helps users quickly recover without disrupting the parking process.

The application allows users to easily reverse actions and adjust their choices, giving them flexibility during navigation and parking selection. These features enhance user control and flexibility, reduce mistakes, and make the app experience smoother and less stressful.
- Back navigation arrow at the top of the screen.
- Can cancel a parking selection.
- Can stop navigation and rechoose a parking slot.

7. **Support Internal Locus of Control**
<p align="center">
<img width="367" height="387" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14e15c8-2d1d-4805-86c9-20de3c1c796f" />
<br>
</p>

The application supports users’ internal locus of control by allowing female drivers to make their own decisions when selecting parking. With the Ladies Parking feature, users can directly choose available slots and control their navigation without relying on automated suggestions.
- Ladies Parking feature highlights available slots for female drivers.
- Users can tap to select their preferred slot.
- Users can choose whether to use AR navigation.
- Users can stop navigation or exit the page at any time

These features empower users to make decisions, increase confidence, and enhance the sense of control, leading to a smoother and more satisfying parking experience while using the app.

8. **Reduce Short-Term Memory Load**
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="390" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8435afc9-c985-4d40-aeb9-070258c856da" />
<br>
</p>

The application is designed to reduce short-term memory load by continuously presenting key parking information in a clear and visual way. This ensures they always know the location of Ladies Parking and the layout of the parking area. 

Important details such as the level and zone of their selected slot are displayed when choosing a space, and AR directional arrows and text icons guide them toward their destination. This approach allows users to make decisions confidently without needing to remember multiple details at once.

- Continuously display level and zone.
- Highlight Ladies Parking location at the start and upon arrival.
- Display zone and level when selecting a slot.
- Use text icons and AR directional arrows to indicate distance and direction.

This reduces cognitive effort, supports confident decision-making, improves orientation in the parking area, and makes the parking experience more efficient, safe, and less stressful.

**Design Requirements from Project #2:**

The Ladies Parking wireframe is designed to extend the requirements established in Project #2 by maintaining clear visual differentiation of reserved parking spaces using pink indicators. The mall should also position Ladies Parking areas near mall entrances with adequate lighting and visible security patrols to enhance safety and accessibility.

The wireframe displays a user profile interface that requires users to update their IC number and profile photograph for verification purposes. Prior to entering the Ladies Parking area, the wireframe provides an on-screen reminder instructing users to scan their face at the physical access barrier, as the biometric verification is performed at the barrier rather than within the application. Once the barrier system completes the facial verification by matching the live scan with the stored profile data, the wireframe displays a confirmation notification indicating whether access has been granted. Barriers will open and female drivers are allowed to enter Ladies Parking areas.

In cases where verification is unsuccessful, the wireframe will  provide a retry option and a help option if there are queries. After attempting 3 times, the barrier system will show an error notification and clearly directs non-verified drivers to general parking. 

Additionally, the wireframe displays navigation guidance from general parking to the Ladies Parking entrance and from the entrance to an available parking slot. The parking interface shows real-time slot availability, updating dynamically to indicate empty slots and allow users to directly select a space, ensuring users are guided accurately to their selected empty parking space.

## 4.0 Interaction Metaphors
### 4.1 Metaphor 1 - The Icons Used in Bottom Navigation Bar
<p align="center">
<img width="750" height="540" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33b863db-5cbb-443e-a8ca-2c8ad7c86419" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.1 : Metaphor 1</em>
</p>

To maintain consistency, the navigation bar uses the same icons in the same position at the bottom of the page. While to enable easy understanding, all icons are designed using familiar real-world metaphors.

1. Menu Page – Home Icon Metaphor
The home icon represents a real house, symbolising a central place. It allows users to return to the main menu at any time, similar to going back home.

2. Notification Page – Bell Icon Metaphor
The bell icon represents a real-life ringing bell used to alert people. It notifies users when new messages or updates are received.

3. Profile Page – User Icon Metaphor
The user icon represents a person, helping users understand that the page contains personal information and account details.

4. Wallet Page – Wallet Icon Metaphor
The wallet icon represents a physical wallet used to store money. It is used to manage payments, balances, and transactions within the system.

5. Settings Page – Gear Icon Metaphor
The gear icon represents tools used for adjustment because gears are used to control, adjust, or transfer motion precisely in mechanical systems. It allows users to customize and control system preferences.

This metaphor-based icon design helps users quickly understand the functions of all icons by leveraging familiar real-life concepts, improving usability and learnability while reducing the learning effort required to use the system. The navigation bar also acts as a boundary that encloses all the icons, allowing users to perceive them as a single unit separate from the rest of the interface, thus fulfilling the Gestalt Principle of Enclosure. Additionally, all icons share a consistent visual style (shape, size, color), so users will perceive them as related and part of the navigation system, fulfilling the Gestalt Principle of Similarity.

### 4.2 Metaphor 2 - The Map
<p align="center">
<img width="400" height="295" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc5b0408-5924-49f7-80dd-3dd56c514e32" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.2 : Metaphor 2</em>
</p>

The main interface is a live, interactive map showing the user's current location, available parking spots, and the car's parked location. 

This justifies that users are highly familiar with map interfaces such as Google Maps or Waze. This metaphor immediately sets the context for finding and navigating locations, which is the primary task of  “Find Parking”.  It visually represents the spatial relationship between the user and available spots, making the direction and distance clear for navigation. The map is the most effective way to layer abstract data like parking slot availability onto a concrete, understandable visual space. This aligns with the requirement for developing a conceptual design that addresses the problem at hand.

### 4.3 Metaphor 3 - The Reserve Slip
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="309" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/305d7f06-42a4-4d9a-be0c-5c2d25082d0d" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.3 : Metaphor 3</em>
</p>

When a user successfully reserves a spot, a notification appears that looks like a digital receipt or slip showing the slot number and specific location. 

A physical receipt gives a sense of official confirmation and ownership. This builds trust in the reservation function and clearly communicates the time constraint, managing user expectations.The slip format allows the app to clearly and quickly present essential constraints, such as the time parked, payment amount, and parking slot number. This adheres to Human Computer Interaction goals of clear feedback and control, ensuring the user is aware of the time they have before the reservation expires. Instead of forcing the user to navigate to a “Reservations” menu to check status, the slip acts as a persistent, immediate confirmation object. This simplifies the post-reservation workflow and supports the user’s primary goal of parking efficiently.

### 4.4 Metaphor 4 - Colour-coded slots
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="330" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68e5e41a-4856-4d02-8721-b8469e0860e8" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.4 : Metaphor 4</em>
</p>

Parking slots are displayed as distinct coloured squares (Green, Red, Pink) acting as visual “beacons” on the map/floor view, instantly conveying their status: Green for Available, Red for Occupied, and Pink for Ladies Parking. Disabled spots use an additional graphic element.

Colour is used to provide immediate, prominent feedback. Red signals an unavailable option, while Green signals an actionable option. This binary distinction reduces the time spent processing information and improves the app’s overall usability goal of efficiency. The colour coding, pink colour is for the specialized “Ladies Parking”, ensures that critical, specialized information is highly distinguishable from standard available spots.

The colour coding of the parking slots (Green for available, Red for occupied) is an effective application of the Traffic Light metaphor. This system also uses the Gestalt Principle of  Similarity to group female parkings with the colour “Pink” and immediately provides semantic feedback, adhering to the usability goal of efficiency by eliminating the need for the user to read text labels for every single spot.

### 4.5 Metaphor 5 - Top-Down Parking Layout Metaphor Showing Car Position
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="410" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b026927-8a2f-4ffe-83e8-63fa55bebd48" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.5 : Metaphor 5</em>
</p>

After the user parks their car, the system automatically detects the parking location using indoor positioning (Bluetooth beacons). In the application, the car is displayed using a top-down view metaphor, giving users a clear representation of its location as if viewed from above, similar to an outdoor parking lot. Although it is not feasible to provide a true top-down visual of the car in multilevel indoor car parks, this metaphor allows users to conceptualize the car’s location in a familiar way, making it easier to understand where their car is located. The interface also displays important details such as level, zone, and slot, reinforcing the user’s mental map of the parking area.

By applying this metaphor, the system exploits users’ prior experience with real-world parking layouts, enabling them to quickly identify the car’s position without having to remember complex indoor structures. This reduces cognitive load, prevents confusion, and improves efficiency when finding the vehicle.

### 4.6 Metaphor 6 - AR Navigation Metaphor for Finding Parked Car
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="353" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29d7a6fb-1a94-4e77-b58e-94b07ac7cefa" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.6 : Metaphor 6</em>
</p>

When users want to find their car, they only need to select their saved car location, and the system provides Augmented Reality (AR) navigation. The AR interface overlays directional arrows and distance indicators directly onto the camera view, guiding users step-by-step toward their vehicle.

In this feature, AR is implemented as a navigation metaphor, where virtual arrows and paths act like real-world directional signs. Users intuitively understand that the arrows indicate where to walk, similar to following signage in a physical car park. This metaphor allows users to easily translate digital guidance into physical movement without needing to interpret maps or remember parking details.

By applying this AR metaphor, the system bridges the digital and physical environments, enabling users to follow a clear and intuitive route in complex indoor car parks. This reduces cognitive load, minimizes unnecessary walking, and improves efficiency when locating the parked car.

### 4.7 Metaphor 7 - Metaphorical Icons and Colors for Ladies’ Parking Access
<p align="center">
<img width="185" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec835ae-ed71-4ad3-8d6e-f0660257689a" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.7 : Metaphor 7</em>
</p>

For the verification of ladies’ parking, the user icon metaphor indicates that the user can proceed with the face scanning process at the barrier. The icon represents a real-world person, helping users intuitively understand that this part of the system relates to their identity. During scanning, the system compares the captured face with the registered IC face data. This user icon metaphor symbolizes a person, allowing the system to visually communicate the abstract process of identity verification.

<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="312" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c53774c6-17b5-4fde-b731-df29790d2887" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.7 : Metaphor 7</em>
</p>

After scanning, if the user’s face matches the registered IC face data, a green checkmark (✔️) icon metaphor is displayed to represent confirmation and success. The green color signals “free to go,” similar to a green pedestrian traffic light, indicating that the user may proceed to access and use the ladies’ parking.
If the verification fails, a red cross (❌) icon metaphor is shown, where the red color reinforces the meaning of error or denial, similar to a red pedestrian traffic light signaling “stop.” This indicates that the user is not allowed to enter the ladies’ parking due to failed verification.
These familiar visual metaphors and color cues help users to immediately understand the verification status, reducing uncertainty and improving confidence during barrier access.


### 4.8 Metaphor 8 - Pink Color and User Icon Metaphors for Ladies’ Parking
<p align="center">
<img width="550" height="346" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afb43aec-a83b-451b-9a6c-bff26d2a3249" />
<br>
   <em>Figure 4.8 : Metaphor 8</em>
</p>

Once a user is verified as a lady and logs in, the Ladies Parking option turns pink, and certain sections of the Ladies Parking page within the app are also highlighted in pink. The pink color serves as a metaphor for female users, leveraging a familiar visual cue to signify ladies’ identity.
A ladies user icon, also colored pink, appears in the top-right corner of the page to indicate that the user is viewing the ladies’ parking section. The same icon is displayed on the in-app parking map to mark the locations of ladies’ parking areas, providing a consistent and intuitive visual metaphor.
This metaphor helps differentiate the general user interface from the ladies’ parking page, ensuring that female users can easily confirm they are in the correct page and identify the reserved parking areas they want to find.
