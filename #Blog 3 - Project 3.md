The wireframe design for Task 1: Find Parking incorporated both Shneider’s Golden Rules and design requirements from Project #2. 
Shneider’s Golden Rules:
The wireframe design for Task 1: Find Parking incorporated both Shneider's Golden Rules and design requirements from Project #2.

**Shneider's Golden Rules:**

1. **Strive for Consistency**
<p align="center">
<img width="650" height="463" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b00234d-4559-4918-b1f4-0fd1d872b32c" />
<br>
</p>

Consistency is strongly maintained throughout the application interface. Every page uses the same bottom navigation bar, which includes Menu, Wallet, Settings, Profile, and Notifications icons. The position, icons, and interaction behaviour do not change across pages.

Moreover, the colours of the parking slots remain unchanged:
- Red always shows occupied parking slots
- Green always shows parking slots that are free
- Pink always stands for ladies' parking
- The wheelchair icon is always used for OKU parking

Such consistency helps the users to understand the system rapidly and apply their knowledge from one page to another without any mistake, thus the usability is raised and the number of errors is diminished.

2. **Enable Frequent Users to Use Shortcuts**
<p align="center">
<img width="450" height="366" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761c3429-0106-4773-b035-15ad461ef16c" />
<br>
</p>

The system has been designed to provide frequent users with a smooth and quick manner of interaction by removing the unnecessary steps. The users are permitted to:
- Directly choose a level and zone
- Press the Search button
- Immediately pick a parking space from the colour-coded layout

There is no need for long instructions or complicated menus. The always visible bottom navigation bar also serves as a shortcut, enabling users to switch rapidly to other main sections of the app whenever they want. In this way, the app becomes time-saving and efficient for repeat users who already know the workflow.

3. **Offer Informative Feedback**
<p align="center">
<img width="170" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53925177-8c7c-4d41-a10c-fc17bf5b1749" />
<br>
</p>

The system delivers explicit and prompt feedback to every user action. If a user picks a parking slot:
- A success message is displayed if the slot is free

This has helped a lot in removing the awkwardness of not knowing and providing clear information to the user about what they have done through each action.

4. **Design Dialogs to Yield Closure**
<p align="center">
<img width="170" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6418e2d7-536c-4f7b-94fa-717e2b89cf06" />
<br>
</p>

The system sequences for every task have not only a clear start and a middle but also an end. When the user completes the navigation for parking:
- A notification confirms the arrival
- A dialog lets the user know if he/she wants to exit the “Find Parking” task

It gives users a firm feeling of closure and a kind of reassurance that the work has been successfully fulfilled. Otherwise, without such closure, users might be wondering if the system is still operational or if there is a need for further action.

5. **Offer Error Prevention and Simple Error Handling**
<p align="center">
<img width="170" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd73e4ca-ce5c-4a8b-b200-b800e1055f41" />
<br>
</p>

Great effort has been put into the design with a view to preventing errors and only handling them softly when they do appear. Red coloured parking spaces that are already taken serve as a clear indication to users that they should not select those parking spaces.

What the system does not do is to penalize a user who picks an occupied slot. Instead, it gives a friendly message to the user asking him/her to choose another slot. This way of dealing with the situation lowers the level of user frustration and keeps the user experience positive and ​‍​‌‍​‍‌pleasant.

6. **Permit Easy Reversal of Actions**
<p align="center">
<img width="168" height="350" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce13ecbf-9050-4bc2-a867-d7e2a59faea5" />
<br>
</p>

At any point in the series of operations, users have the ability to undo or reverse their actions. Every page has a return (back) button which enables users to:
- Change the selected level or zone
- Cancel the parking selection

The users are thus not trapped in a sequence and they can recover from mistakes without having to start the entire process over again. By giving this option, the app lessens the user's anxiety and irritation, thus the user feels more comfortable to choose different options and the app becomes more user-friendly in character. Users can go through the system with confidence, knowing that if they make mistakes, these can be easily ​‍​‌‍​‍‌rectified.

7. **Support Internal Locus of Control**
