## 💬 Description of Our Group Name
Our group chose the name **“Error 404”** because we are network students who recently learned about network server error codes.  
The term *Error 404* is commonly seen when a webpage cannot be found, and in **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**, we often encounter this error when trying to access certain websites.  
This makes the name both **relatable** and **memorable** to us.

> 💡 *"Just like the 404 error, we may get lost sometimes — but we always find our way back through teamwork and learning!"*
