# Project 1 - Project Proposal

## <ins>Problem</ins>


The​‍​‌‍​‍‌ world is full of different smart parking systems that include automatic pay stations and barriers, auto pay parking systems, active RFID parking systems, robotic parking systems, Parking Guidance and Information System (PGIS), transit-based information system, smart payment system, e-parking, and automated parking<sup>[1]</sup>. This Human Computer Interaction (HCI) project focused on identifying the typical issues with indoor car parking systems as well as an innovative solution of a smart parking system to solve the ​‍​‌‍​‍‌problem.

Based on the research, the conventional indoor car parking system does not provide the drivers regarding the availability of parking spaces. As a result, many of the drivers who enter the parking lot waste their time searching for parking. The conventional indoor car parking system will just open the barrier when drivers press the automated machine for tickets or tap their TouchNGo card to enter without showing the availability number of parking spaces<sup>[1]</sup> which can be shown in Figure 1.1 below.

This will not only cause unnecessary user usability problems which are a waste of time and fuel but it will also pollute the environment. ​Studies revealed that the time used by drivers looking for available parking spots (termed as "cruising") which can be shown in Figure 1.2 is a major cause of the increase in vehicle miles traveled as well as the release of greenhouse gases.

Just to present one case, the average cruising time in the city of Los Angeles of more than 3 minutes per driver has brought about an additional 932,000 km of vehicle miles driven and 730 metric tons of CO2 emissions per year<sup>[2]</sup> and can contribute to a negative user driving experience where the drivers will feel frustrated and stress<sup>[3]</sup>.

Most modern buildings such as shopping centers, airports, universities, and business buildings have large indoor car parks that cover several floors and hundreds of parking spaces. While these parking lots are designed to accommodate more vehicles, they often leave drivers with a difficulty remembering where they left their cars. After a day of work or shopping, many people find themselves wandering through parking levels trying to recall where they left their vehicles<sup>[4]</sup>. This not only causes frustration and stress but also waste valuable time and be the cause of unnecessary traffic congestion inside the parking areas.

One of the primary usability issues in today's parking facilities is the inefficacy of finding a parked car. Most current facilities use basic numbering schemes marked on pillars or painted walls. These labels are easy to miss or forgotten, particularly if the driver is rushing. For example, a driver might just remember parking "by the elevator" or "next to a red car," but both of those memories are encountered useless because all those parking slot designs are the same at the whole building which can be shown in Figure 2.1 below. Some people even manually mark down their parking spot by taking down the labelled number on the painted wall or just taking a photo of it as shown in Figure 2.2 below. These extra steps are not convenient for users who want quick, one-touch solutions.

Based on the study by Mora, Allard, and Zurob (2014), wayfinding behavior in large parking lots, particularly those in shopping malls, often leads to significant user difficulties. The researchers found that many drivers forget not just which level they parked on, but even the exact spot, making their return trip stressful and inefficient<sup>[4]</sup>. This will make drivers spend unnecessary minutes searching their cars, typically often circling the area multiple times. This causes many users to feel anxiety, annoyance or panic when they cannot find their cars, particularly in crowded parking structures. This kind of negative emotional result decreases their level of comfort with the overall parking service and creates an unpleasant impression of the building. For instance, after spending the entire day shopping, users might forget which floor they parked on, thus turning an enjoyable day into a stressful experience.

Overall, the difficulty of locating parked vehicles in large multi-level parking facilities highlights a major usability issue that affects both efficiency and user satisfaction. As demonstrated by Mora, Allard, and Zurob (2014), poor wayfinding design contributes to confusion, emotional stress, and wasted time for drivers<sup>[4]</sup>. These challenges show the need to improve parking management systems and smarter navigational aids that can help users easily locate their vehicles. Implementing such solutions would not only enhance user convenience but also reduce congestion and improve the overall perception of modern parking facilities. 

Other than the problems of finding available parking spaces and locating one’s own car, ladies’ parking, which serves as designated bays for female drivers, is often misused. These spaces are reserved specifically for single women, groups of women, and single mothers with boys under 12 years old<sup>[5]</sup>. According to a survey by LiveView Technologies (LVT), 69% of women reported feeling unsafe in parking lots, which often influences their decision to visit shopping malls<sup>[6]</sup>. A real and tragic example is the Canny Ong case, where she was abducted from a parking lot in 2003. This incident serves as a strong reminder of the importance of ensuring women’s safety in conventional indoor parking systems.

Ladies’ parking areas are designed with security guards and numerous CCTV cameras that provide constant monitoring to help prevent suspicious individuals from committing crimes which can be shown in figure 3.1. They are usually located close to the main entrances and exits, with wider parking spaces and fewer blind spots for better visibility. In addition, the lighting in these areas is much brighter compared to regular parking spaces, making them easier to notice and safer to navigate. Overall, ladies’ parking helps reduce crime rates, ensure women’s safety, and allow female drivers to feel secure even during late hours or in less-crowded areas.

However, it is common to hear complaints about weak enforcement by security personnel. This allows some individuals to take advantage of the ladies’ parking spaces when they see many empty spots, even though they are not eligible to use them. This includes couples and families who justify their actions by claiming that their wife or girlfriend was the driver<sup>[7]</sup>. Such behavior goes against the original purpose of ladies’ parking which is to provide safety and reduce women’s fear of potential crimes. Some people even claim they did not realize it was a ladies’ parking area, despite the clearly marked pink signs and female icons displayed around the spaces as shown in figure 3.2.

</p>

Consequently, women who genuinely need these designated spaces are often left without a safe place to park. They are forced to use general parking areas with limited security patrols and poor lighting for surveillance. Over time, women become disappointed with the parking system as the effectiveness of ladies’ parking decreases.

## <ins>Proposed Solution</ins>
According to the problem space analysis, it is clearly shown that citizens nowadays face issues such as inconvenience in finding available parking spaces, which can contribute to a negative driving experience where drivers feel frustrated and increase CO₂ emissions. Additionally, the inefficacy of finding a parked car may cause users to feel anxiety, annoyance, or panic, and women face insecurities regarding ladies’ parking due to misuse by others. Realizing that these issues significantly impact daily life and do not align with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), our group proposed designing an Indoor Smart Parking and Navigation Application named ParkMate.

First and foremost, IoT technology is used for real-time parking availability tracking. IoT devices installed in each parking slot—using ultrasonic sensors, motion sensors, or cameras—detect whether the space is occupied or free. Data is then transmitted in real-time to a central server, which updates the availability status. The ParkMate app fetches this data and displays an interactive, colour-coded map of the car park: Green for vacant, Red for occupied, and Pink for ladies’ parking. Drivers can see available parking spaces before entering the parking lot. The ParkMate interface categorizes availability by floor or zone according to the building. Users can then select a vacant parking slot on the map, and the app provides navigation, guiding them directly to the chosen spot. This reduces users’ time spent on circling and searching, minimizes unnecessary driving inside parking lots, and leads to lower fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions as well as relieving panic.

In order to overcome the problem of inefficiency in finding a parked car, ParkMate introduces a “Find My Car” feature with GPS and AR navigation. When the driver parks their car, the app automatically logs the exact GPS coordinates and floor/zone of the vehicle, and indoor navigation is enhanced using Bluetooth beacons or Wi-Fi triangulation for multi-level parking as soon as the parking transaction is confirmed. When users forget where they parked, they can track their vehicle in the app, and AR navigation guides them back to it. Users can follow GPS directions to find their car, while AR navigation overlays real-world cues for easier orientation. This personalized feature provides a quick, one-touch solution for users to locate their vehicles and improve the overall user experience. AR navigation is particularly helpful for elderly users or individuals with a poor sense of direction. These features reduce user stress and frustration during the parking process.

Although the emergence of ladies’ parking has improved safety, the misuse of these spaces is becoming a serious issue and significantly affects the security and confidence of female drivers. In the ParkMate system, female drivers can register their details and verify their identity using their IC number (the last digit can indicate gender) along with a selfie for AI verification. This data is securely stored on the central server. When a registered female driver wishes to park, she can simply scan her face at the parking barrier for verification. The barrier system cross-checks the driver’s identity with the database before granting access. This prevents male drivers from claiming that a female driver is present if the app or facial scan does not match. The barrier will only open when the scanned identity matches the registered female driver information and will remain closed otherwise, while issuing a digital alert or audio message directing the driver to general parking. Since the barrier scans from the driver’s side, it effectively prevents misuse of ladies’ parking by male drivers.

In conclusion, ParkMate is a smart parking solution designed to directly tackle the frustrations and inefficiencies of modern urban parking. By integrating IoT for real-time tracking, advanced GPS and AR technology for seamless navigation and car location, and a secure facial recognition barrier for ladies' parking, ParkMate significantly improves the entire driver experience. This approach helps to reduce frustrating circle-searching, minimizes CO₂ emissions, and provides a vital layer of security and confidence for female drivers. Ultimately, ParkMate contributes meaningfully to the vision of Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) by transforming stressful, time-consuming parking into a safe, efficient, and environmentally conscious part of daily life.

## <ins>Target Users</ins>
The​‍​‌‍​‍‌ ParkMate – Smart Parking and Navigation App is a proposed solution that has been conceptualized around the requirements of various users who frequently face inconveniences in the case of an in-door parking situation. As a result of the research done previously and the subsequent evaluation of the situations, the main target user groups have been figured out which are lone drivers, female drivers, as well as elderly drivers. Every group has particular problems related to the system's usability and user experience that the planned system is intended to ​‍​‌‍​‍‌solve.

The first target user group is identified as lone drivers, which also covers single individuals who regularly drive alone to their workplaces, shopping malls, and universities.These users face the inconvenience of locating free parking spots, especially during rush hours in large multi-level car parks. This will inflate frustration, wasting time, increased fuel consumptions, and also causes traffic congestion. To avoid this situation, ParkMate has brought in a Real-time Parking Availability and Navigation service that is lone driver friendly and allows them to quickly locate vacant parking slots and the route to the same.

The system gathers the information through Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as ultrasonic sensors, motion sensors, or cameras that are fixed in each parking space to detect occupancy. The real-time occupancy data is then sent to a central server, where it is processed and shown in the ParkMate application. Users can open an interactive, colour-coded map that shows the parking status: green for vacant, red for occupied, and pink for ladies’ parking. If a vacant locker is chosen, the app provides the navigation guidance necessary to lead the driver to the selected place in the most efficient way. The implementation of this solution has been a great indoor parking system usability enhancer as it has lowered the search time, thus, saving the fuel consumption and providing a more comfortable and convenient parking experience for lone‍ ​‍‌drivers.

Other than that, the ParkMate Smart Parking and Navigation App is designed for a wide range of users who often struggle to find their parked vehicles in large indoor parking areas like shopping malls, airports, and business buildings. Previous studies and real-world observations show that the main target users for this system include all drivers, especially elderly individuals who might have more difficulty with memory, orientation, and navigation. Each group has specific needs that the proposed system aims to address by providing an intelligent, user-friendly, and accessible parking assistance experience.

Another target group is elderly drivers, who may have trouble remembering where they parked or navigating through vast, similar-looking parking lots. Due to potential mobility issues and memory decline, elderly users often feel more stress and confusion when searching for their vehicles. ParkMate’s “Find My Car” feature addresses these problems by using GPS tracking and AR (Augmented Reality) navigation. This allows users to visually follow real-world clues to their parked cars. The system’s interface focuses on simplicity, with clear visuals, large icons, and optional voice guidance to ensure a comfortable experience for elderly users.

In addition, general drivers such as working adults, students, and families can benefit from this system as well. Many drivers, regardless of age, feel frustrated when trying to locate their vehicles after long hours of shopping or working. By using Bluetooth beacons, Wi-Fi triangulation, and real-time GPS updates, ParkMate accurately records and shows the user’s car location on an interactive map. The AR navigation provides step-by-step guidance, helping users reach their vehicles efficiently while reducing stress, saving time, and lessening congestion in the parking area. Thus, the ParkMate app aims to improve the overall parking experience for all users, especially elderly drivers, by providing a smooth, intuitive, and hassle-free way to find parked vehicles in large indoor parking facilities.

Last but not least, female drivers are one of the most concerned user groups. They often face problems when men intrude into ladies’ parking areas where they are not supposed to be, combined with weak on-site security. As a result, many women feel unsafe and uncomfortable when parking, especially during late hours or in poorly lit areas. 
This situation highlights the need for a more secure and reliable system to protect female drivers.

With the ParkMate system, an automated ladies’ parking access control is implemented to address this issue. The system uses the IC number to differentiate gender and ensure that only verified female users are registered. At the parking barrier, a facial recognition camera compares the driver’s face with the registered data in the ParkMate system. If the identity matches a registered female driver, the barrier will open automatically; otherwise, access will be denied. This solution helps to prevent misuse of ladies’ parking, enhances safety for women, and promotes a secure and inclusive parking environment.
